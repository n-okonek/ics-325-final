 <?php echo "Love to learn about other cultures, this place has three 
 major tribes and nine collectives. Here you will learn how to live in 
 the culture of different tribes. This includes beauty maintenance, 
 skin cleansing, being one with nature. If you want to be off grid, 
 this homey area is the place for you. They are cut off from electricity, 
 transportation, and even potable water. This destination is raw at heart 
 and brings you back to the roots of living. Some of you might even come 
 back with some new piercings or tattoos depending on which tribe tickles 
 your fancy most. There will be dance and song to be learned, mating rituals 
 and marriages, and learning about sustenance from the dark ages. This 
 destination is more for the people who wished to be humbled by the simplicities 
 of the past."; ?>
