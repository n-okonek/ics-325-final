If you are unsure about how to clone a repo let me know.
I might be able to walk you through it

Mike your branch is called mikes

Meygan your branch is called meygans

First thing you'll need to do is clone the repo to your local working directory. Once that is done just checkout your branch and start working on it.

I propose code reviews before we merge anything into the master which I can then upload to a site with current PHP so we don't have to rely on long hand methods and functions. 

If any of us get stuck somewhere, we can checkout each others branch to view the state at the last commit, without making changes to our own branches.

##Overview:
Our team objective is to develop a travel app titled “The Wanderlust Outpost” that is focused more on excursions and unique experiences opposed to just lodging and airfare, The need for this app was brought to my attention when trying to find activities for a mid-sized group when traveling as most of the webpages were either nonresponsive or were outdated. The goal for our development teams is to provide destination and experience information on many travel locations, allow users to rate these location and experiences, share photos of these experiences and share information through the app forum. A discussion about hosting travel advisories has come up, but that feature may be out of scope 
Our team foresees three groups as predominate users of this applications: Administrators, Registered user, and guest users (with perhaps a four being providers, if the application sustains enough traffic to grow). The Wanderlust Outpost would host a different set of features for registered users and guest users, this would allow the site to have functionality for viewing by casual users and for committed users to build the overall experience on the application.  We want to encourage users to become registered as they will also be content providers and a critical piece of the further development of the “Wanderlust Outpost” 

##REQUIREMENT SPECS

-	Each user would have a unique profile 

####Guest users:
