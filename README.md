If you are unsure about how to clone a repo let me know.
I might be able to walk you through it

Mike your branch is called mikes

Meygan your branch is called meygans

First thing you'll need to do is clone the repo to your local working directory. Once that is done just checkout your branch and start working on it.

I propose code reviews before we merge anything into the master which I can then upload to a site with current PHP so we don't have to rely on long hand methods and functions. 

If any of us get stuck somewhere, we can checkout each others branch to view the state at the last commit, without making changes to our own branches.
